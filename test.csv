$H 250528--PubCom-NCUA-GregoryJohnson,Truliant Federal Credit Union Appeals for Guidance Instead of Rules on Succession Planning,"WASHINGTON, May 28 -- Truliant Federal Credit Union has submitted a letter to the National Credit Union Administration, expressing concerns about proposed regulations regarding succession planning. In a letter dated May 19, 2025, Gregory T. Johnson, Chairman of the Board of Directors for Truliant, emphasized the importance of tailored guidance over prescriptive rules that could burden credit unions.

Headquartered in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Truliant Federal Credit Union serves over 340,000 members across North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia, boasting $5.2 billion in assets. The credit union is designated as a low-income Community Development Financial Institution and has a dedicated workforce of nearly 1,000 employees.

Johnson stated, We agree with the NCUA that succession planning is vital to the long-term success of a credit union. However, we feel the NCUA...would be better served addressing this priority through guidance rather than through overly prescriptive rulemaking. He expressed concern that the proposed rule could impose significant constraints and added regulatory burdens, which would challenge a credit union's ability to serve its members effectively.

The letter outlined that the NCUA's estimate of only 10 compliance hours per year for credit unions was unrealistic. Johnson mentioned, the process of understanding the rule's requirements...and documenting the succession plan is a lengthy process. He urged the agency to reconsider its approach, suggesting that tailored guidance would better meet the unique needs of individual credit unions.

Highlighting an existing relationship, Johnson noted that recent tailored feedback from the NCUA helped Truliant enhance its succession plan. He stressed the importance of maintaining autonomy in governance, advocating instead for regulatory guidance that aligns with the realities of the credit union landscape.

Johnson concluded, urging the NCUA to reconsider advancing the proposed rule, asserting that finalizing a prescriptive rule...will distract us from our mission.

$H 250528--PubCom-FTC-MichelleOwen,National Organization of Rheumatology Management Urges U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission to Address Anticompetitive Regulations,"WASHINGTON, May 28 -- In a letter dated May 27, 2025, the National Organization of Rheumatology Management (NORM) addressed the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, highlighting pressing concerns regarding anticompetitive regulations affecting rheumatology practices. NORM advocates for reforms that would improve patient care and practice sustainability amidst financial pressures.

Our members manage the day-to-day operations of rheumatology practices and have firsthand experience navigating regulatory obstacles, stated the letter's author. NORM emphasizes that declining Medicare payment rates, which have dropped by 33% since 2001 when adjusted for inflation, significantly impact rheumatologists, particularly those in small, independent, and rural practices.

The organization expressed concern about Medicare payment structures, stating, Stagnant payment updates, inflexible budget neutrality rules, and irregular practice expense updates continue to push small, rural, and independent rheumatology practices toward consolidation. NORM encourages policymakers to tie future updates of the Medicare physician fee schedule to the Medicare Economic Index to better align payments with actual cost growth.

NORM also addressed issues related to Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), stating that the consolidation of the PBM industry creates barriers for both providers and patients. PBM-driven formulary design, rebate-driven exclusions, and utilization management tactics-like step therapy-create administrative burden, delay care, and force physicians to navigate unnecessary barriers, the letter read.

Furthermore, the group highlighted challenges surrounding biosimilar medications and prior authorization, advocating for modifications that would streamline processes and ensure better patient access to essential treatments.

Through this letter, NORM seeks engagement with the DOJ and FTC to implement necessary reforms that would promote fair competition and enhance patient care in the field of rheumatology.

$H 250528--PubCom-FTC-BrianNyquist,National Infusion Center Association Urges Federal Action to Address Payment Inequities and Anticompetitive Practices,"WASHINGTON, May 28 -- In a letter dated May 27, 2025, the National Infusion Center Association has called on the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to investigate anticompetitive regulations that threaten the survival of community-based infusion centers. The nonprofit, based in Austin, Texas, advocates for clinics providing vital provider-administered medications, expressing grave concerns over current Medicare payment structures that exacerbate financial instability.

The erosion of Medicare Physician Fee Schedule payments over the past five years is not just unsustainable; it is structurally anticompetitive, stated the Association. Since 2020, Medicare payments have been reduced, leading to dire consequences for infusion practices that deliver resource-intensive services. The Association reports that inflation-adjusted payments have declined by 33% since 2001, creating an uneven playing field when compared to hospital-based providers who benefit from more stable reimbursement structures.

The letter also highlights the flawed assumptions underlying the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' budget neutrality policies, which have resulted in steep payment cuts based on inaccurate projections. The net result is not budget neutrality, but rather a permanent reduction in Medicare physician payments across-the-board, the Association explained.

Furthermore, the Association called for increased transparency and oversight of pharmacy benefit managers, whose consolidation over the prescription drug market has had detrimental effects on patient access and competition, suggesting legislative reforms would be necessary to mitigate these challenges. Until PBMs are held accountable for their pricing practices, patients and providers will continue to face access barriers, they concluded.

The National Infusion Center Association urges swift action to refine payment systems and eliminate disparities that hinder competition and access to care for Medicare beneficiaries.

$H 250528--PubCom-VA-AUTHNOTFOUND,Commonwealth of Virginia Responds to Draft Programmatic Environmental Assessment by U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs,"WASHINGTON, May 28 -- In a letter dated May 23, 2025, the Commonwealth of Virginia's Department of Environmental Quality has provided feedback on the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Draft Programmatic Environmental Assessment (PEA) for the Build-to-Suit Lease Program. This review comes as the VA seeks to analyze projects related to the construction and operation of outpatient clinics and other medical facilities across 50 states and territories.

The Department of Environmental Quality coordinates Virginia's review of federal environmental documents and emphasizes the collaborative nature of the process. The following agencies participated in this review: the Department of Wildlife Resources, Department of Conservation and Recreation, Department of Health, and others, said Stefanie K. Taillon, Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources. Our collective aim is to ensure that any actions taken align with both state and federal environmental obligations.

The Draft PEA outlines that projects covered under the program include lease constructions of up to 250,000 square feet or 25 acres, alongside renovations of any size. It stipulates that larger projects would necessitate standalone National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) documentation. The PEA provides an essential framework for building new medical facilities, while also ensuring that necessary environmental considerations are not overlooked, explained Michael S. Rolband, Director of the Department of Environmental Quality.

The review found that potential impacts to air quality would be minimal, supporting the notion that the proposed action would result in less than significant impacts. Mitigation measures will be enforced to control fugitive dust and manage emissions, adhering to Virginia's air quality regulations.

As discussions continue, the Commonwealth remains committed to fostering a collaborative approach, underscoring that local environmental impacts must be a priority in the development of the VA's Build-to-Suit Lease Program.

$H 250528--PubCom-FMCSA-MichaelMillard,"Concern Raised Over Exemption Application by AWM Associates, LLC to Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration","WASHINGTON, May 28 -- In a letter dated May 23, 2025, Michael Millard, President and Chief Safety Officer of AWM Associates, LLC, based in Albuquerque, New Mexico, expressed serious concerns regarding the exemption application submitted by William Cole, Safety Coordinator for the Montana Trucking Association, to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. Millard's letter highlights apprehensions about Cole's qualifications to provide hazardous materials (HM) training under the Entry-Level Driver Training regulations.

Millard noted that Cole's request for exemption from the requirement in 49 CFR 380.605, which mandates that HM theory instructors possess at least two years of driving experience with the appropriate class of certification, lacks important substantiation. Despite Mr. Cole's significant credentials, Millard wrote, the fact remains, he has no evidence of operating a commercial motor vehicle that requires a commercial driver's license.

In addition to highlighting Cole's qualifications such as being a Certified Safety & Health Official (CSHO) and a member of the American Trucking Association's Law Enforcement Advisory Board, Millard questioned the feasibility of Cole teaching essential HM training topics without appropriate firsthand driving experience. He referred to critical units of required training, emphasizing the importance of practical experience in conveying information about safe operation at railroad grade crossings and the safe handling of hazardous materials.

Millard concluded emphatically, Mr. Cole's application should be denied, urging the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to reconsider the implications of allowing someone without the necessary driving background to instruct on such vital safety measures. The outcome of this review remains to be seen as stakeholders monitor the Federal Register for updates on the application.

The company, based in Istanbul, Turkey, is a manufacturer specializing in advanced battery technology. 

Through our continuous improvement practices, we address compliance and sustainability daily, stated the author of the letter. However, they highlighted that recent regulatory changes may place an undue burden on small manufacturers like theirs. As a small business, the new requirements could overwhelm our capacity to thrive and innovate, they emphasized.

The letter pointed out that SuperBiaotrt has maintained a 99% annual recycling rate and engaged in environmentally responsible practices. However, it noted that the Federal Agency's latest regulatory demands might exceed the capabilities of smaller enterprises. We want to ensure that regulations do not disproportionately impact our operations, hindering our ability to contribute to the industry, the letter advised.

SuperBiaotrt's representatives also highlighted ongoing efforts to comply with safety standards and environmental assessments, asserting that rigorous regulations should accommodate the specific circumstances of small businesses. We're committed to safety and environmental stewardship, but we ask you to recognize the unique challenges we face, the letter conveyed.

Moreover, the company expressed the need for continued dialogue with the Federal Agency to ensure that regulations support innovation and competitiveness in the automotive battery sector. We believe constructive engagement between government regulators and industry stakeholders is essential to develop effective solutions, they concluded.

The letter serves as a call for balance, urging the Federal Agency to consider the nuances of small manufacturer circumstances while formulating future regulations.

$H 250528--PubCom-ATR-SoumiSaha,Premier Inc. Calls for Streamlining Antitrust Regulations for Healthcare Innovation,"WASHINGTON, May 28 -- In a letter dated May 22, 2025, Premier Inc., a leading healthcare improvement company, urged the U.S. Department of Justice to take action on anticompetitive regulations that hinder innovation in the healthcare sector. The letter outlines key recommendations for reducing administrative burdens that limit patient-centered care.

Premier supports the Administration's efforts to reduce administrative burdens that have limited clinical benefits, stated Premier's leadership. We recommend that the DOJ focus on establishing national privacy priorities and clarifying enforcement decisions.

The organization, which operates from Charlotte, North Carolina, represents an alliance of 4,350 hospitals and approximately 325,000 healthcare providers, emphasizing the criticality of streamlined regulations to enable technology advancements. Premier's recommendations include examining equal information blocking penalties, which they argue will foster fair data sharing among healthcare entities.

Currently, the regulatory environment too often creates complex compliance systems, the letter continued. This ecosystem inhibits innovation and diverts resources that should be used for patient care towards bureaucratic compliance.

Premier criticized the fragmented privacy laws that currently hinder healthcare providers by creating a difficult landscape for startups and new market entrants. The letter pointed to the European Union's approach, which has standardized data protections but created barriers for innovation through overly restrictive regulations.

Establishing a uniform, predictable federal privacy standard is crucial for competition, Premier's leadership emphasized. They called for the DOJ to use its rulemaking authority to provide clear guidelines that would establish enforcement priorities, thereby giving every player in the market a fair chance to compete.

Premier Inc.'s advocacy reflects the pressing need for regulatory reforms in a rapidly evolving healthcare landscape. The organization's vision aims to transform healthcare delivery through innovation while ensuring that patient care remains the forefront of industry developments.

$H 250528--PubCom-ATR-MerithBasey,Patients For Affordable Drugs Submits Comments on Federal Trade Commission Inquiry to Lower Prescription Drug Prices,"WASHINGTON, May 28 -- In a letter dated May 22, 2025, Merith Basey, Executive Director of Patients For Affordable Drugs (P4AD), urged the Federal Trade Commission to take decisive action against anti-competitive regulatory barriers that contribute to high prescription drug prices. P4AD, a national patient advocacy organization, has collected over 38,000 patient stories highlighting the affordability crisis in the U.S.

The United States is facing a drug affordability crisis, Basey stated. One in three people in the U.S. cannot afford to pay for their prescription drugs. She emphasized that Americans, particularly older adults, are forced to choose between necessary medications and other essential expenses due to exorbitant prices.

Basey's letter commended the previous administration's efforts to lower drug costs, but warned that ongoing abuses of the patent system hinder real change. Pharmaceutical manufacturers abuse the current patent system, not to reward innovation, but to block affordable generic and biosimilar drugs from coming to market, she explained.

The letter cites alarming statistics showing that while generic drugs make up over 90 percent of prescriptions filled, they account for only 17 percent of total prescription spending. Market entry of six or more generic drugs can lower drug prices by 95 percent, Basey noted, underscoring the importance of promoting competition in the pharmaceutical market.

Basey called on the administration to support bipartisan legislative efforts aimed at curbing harmful patent practices, stating, We urge the administration to support bipartisan bills in Congress that would ban some of these abusive patent practices and increase competition. By addressing these issues, she believes it is possible to lower prices and ensure that patients do not have to endure financial hardship to access necessary medications.

$H 250528--PubCom-ATR-SondraDePalma,American Academy of Physician Associates Urges Federal Agency to Address Anticompetitive Regulations,"WASHINGTON, May 28 -- In a letter dated May 22, 2025, the American Academy of Physician Associates (AAPA) urged the Anticompetitive Regulations Task Force at the United States Department of Justice to reevaluate regulations that hinder free market competition in healthcare. Representing over 180,000 physician assistants in the U.S., the AAPA aims to collaborate with the Task Force to identify and eliminate unnecessary regulatory barriers.

AAPA seeks to work in partnership with the Department of Justice's newly formed Anticompetitive Regulations Task Force to identify regulations that increase costs by restricting PA practice with no basis in evidence or patient safety, the letter states. The organization highlights the potential of physician assistants to significantly enhance healthcare access, particularly if unnecessary federal regulations are removed.

Currently, PAs practice across all medical specialties and have been identified by the Bureau of Labor Statistics as experiencing one of the fastest employment growth rates among healthcare providers, with a projected growth of 28% through 2033. This growth is not arbitrary but stems from the pivotal contributions these professionals make to our healthcare system, the letter emphasized.

The AAPA also outlined the rigorous education and training required of physician assistants, noting that PAs complete a curriculum closely aligned with that of medical school. This ensures they are highly qualified healthcare providers, capable of producing quality care comparable to that of physicians.

The letter pointed specifically to anticompetitive laws that create barriers for PAs, limiting their ability to deliver cost-effective and high-quality care. Removing anti-competitive barriers identified during previous administrations could greatly improve healthcare for individuals across the country, AAPA stated.

In conclusion, the AAPA reiterated that addressing these anticompetitive regulations is crucial for enhancing healthcare access and reducing costs in a rapidly evolving healthcare landscape.

Representing approximately 5,000 member hospitals and health systems, the AHA emphasized the significant impact of regulatory burdens on the ability of health care providers to compete fairly.

The ever-expanding morass of complicated federal regulation imposes massive costs on the lives of millions of Americans, the letter stated, echoing sentiments shared by the previous Trump administration regarding the need for regulatory reforms. The AHA expressed consistent concerns over how these regulations limit market competition and access to health care, raising costs for patients without improving quality.

The letter highlighted findings from a 2018 report indicating that numerous laws and regulations have historically restricted competition among health care providers. The AHA pointed out that despite previous evaluations of the regulatory landscape, many issues remain unresolved or have intensified over time. 

The regulations we face create significant administrative costs, disincentivize pro-competitive arrangements, and promote vertical consolidation of large commercial insurers, stated an AHA representative. The organization laid out specific instances where regulations have provided an unlevel playing field, allowing large commercial insurers to dominate the market, thereby constraining consumer choice and access to care.

UnitedHealth Group was singled out as a leading example of anticompetitive behavior within the industry, given its extensive reach in health insurance and health care services. The AHA called for a series of recommendations aimed at mitigating these challenges, asserting that an effective regulatory environment would foster competition, lower costs, and ultimately improve health outcomes for Americans.

$H 250528--PubCom-ATR-WalterHamilton,Indiana Association of Nurse Anesthetists Calls for Reform in Anticompetitive State Laws,"WASHINGTON, May 28 -- In a letter dated October 1, 2023, the Indiana Association of Nurse Anesthetists called on the United States Department of Justice Anticompetitive Regulations Task Force to address the restrictive impact of certain state laws on certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) in Indiana. The association, which represents over 800 CRNAs and nurse anesthesia residents across the nation, expressed concerns that current regulations impede competition and limit patient access to healthcare.

The Indiana nursing statute mandates that CRNAs operate under the direction of physicians, despite their extensive training in administering anesthesia independently. Restrictive physician involvement in CRNA practice raises several competitive concerns for patients, stated Walter V. Hamilton III, the Federal Political Director of the Indiana Association of Nurse Anesthetists. He highlighted that unnecessary oversight can lead to increased healthcare costs and inefficient use of resources, particularly in rural areas where CRNAs are often the only anesthesia providers.

The letter outlined how the current regulations create barriers to reimbursement and provider innovation. Hamilton emphasized that removing these directives could enhance competition in the market, stating, CRNAs practicing independently can alleviate concerns with access and cost of care.

The association pointed out that approximately 40% of Indiana counties rely solely on CRNAs for anesthesia services, underscoring the dire need for these professionals in underserved communities. Limiting CRNA practice can lead to decreased patient safety and does not improve outcomes, Hamilton added, referencing ongoing research that fails to demonstrate a correlation between physician supervision and enhanced patient safety.

The Indiana Association of Nurse Anesthetists is advocating for a reform that would allow CRNAs to practice to their full scope of education and training, ultimately improving healthcare access and quality in Indiana.

The ACC, a leading organization with over 60,000 cardiovascular professionals worldwide, emphasizes its commitment to improving heart health. The letter outlines how current restrictions, particularly the Stark law and anti-kickback statutes, pose critical challenges for clinicians. These complex laws cannot be fixed with minor adjustments, states the ACC. Instead, the laws and enabling regulations have imposed significant hurdles to innovation in care delivery models.

The organization argues that these regulations, conceptualized when many practices were independent, are now outdated due to significant shifts in how healthcare is delivered. A comprehensive review could foster an environment in which independent physician practice can regain their footing and deliver high-value care, adds the ACC's letter.

The letter also highlights the adverse effects of restrictive covenants and non-competition clauses, stating these practices create barriers to patient care. Physicians who choose to leave for personal reasons are essentially forced to abandon their patients, the ACC writes. The organization calls for collaboration among the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to scrutinize these clauses, fearing they may be fueling healthcare consolidation and rising costs.

As the ACC drives its mission to enhance cardiovascular care, the letter reflects a growing concern about maintaining accessible, high-quality healthcare for all Americans amidst evolving regulatory landscapes.
